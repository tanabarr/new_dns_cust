Installing executable just set up the python libraries?
Install scripts in macrosystem directory of natlink
pkg_resources required for configurations script (dragonfly_tools) to work
dragonfly results in more convenient access to compound grammars in natlink (offers a layer of abstraction)
installing setuptools-0.6c11-py2.6.egg (md5) seems to fix problems with pkg_resources (using the Windows installer), now commands like "show dragonfly version" work. (Or was it updating dragonfly?)
Dragonfly is installed as an egg package.
Download files from website and save in macro system as .py
how do config files work? A: overwrite some of the data specified within the python file, provides isolated customisation.
Where are they stored ? A: same directory with same beginning of name.l

Ctypes method within monitor.PY replaced with win32api method
window object exposed in winctrl.py seems to not beDragonfly type but more win32 type, passed in "extras" parameter, investigate…
