unchanged wrong grammar file errors because dragonfly not installed.
Install dragonfly with administrator privileges

Tasklist not allowed with user privileges??

Occasionally get recounts of error "cannot be lodged with user privileges"

Log out and logging seems to fix this.nsrst script was trying to save log in Dragon directory, change to work from desktop.
Remove user profiles so that it can start automatically (is created within the administrative account, need to login as administrator to remove)
natlink uses variable to keep track of username and store temporary files in desktop of this user.
No point in using taskkill /T has have to terminate by force.
Pruned unnecessary text from script.
